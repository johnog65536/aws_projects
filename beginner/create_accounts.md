# Very basic setup 

1. Create an account, and setup MFA on the root user (15 minutes)
2. Setup a budget with spending alarms & go into cost explorer so it activates (15 minutes)
3. Enable IAM billing (5 minutes)
4. Setup an IAM user with admin permissions, and MFA & use this going forward, instead of thre root user (10 minutes)
